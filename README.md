# IIIT Hyderabad UG2023 Resources

I've added the resources from the courses I've taken as an ECE undergrad. If some question papers are missing, the specific exam was tested differently, i.e. we were not allowed to keep the papers.

The following courses have been uploaded for now:

- Semester 1
    - Computer Programming (CS0.101)
    - Digital Systems and Microcontrollers (EC2.101)
    - Real Analysis (MA4.101)
    - Networks, Signals and Systems (EC5.101)
    - Electronic Workshop-1 (EC2.102)
- Semester 2
    - Linear Algebra (MA2.101)
    - Analog Electronic Circuits (EC2.103)
    - Information and Communication (EC5.102)
    - Data Structures and Algorithms (CS1.201)

And of course, refer to similar repositories for [UG2022](https://github.com/zyx7k/course-material) and [UG2021](https://github.com/brahad316/course-material) :)
