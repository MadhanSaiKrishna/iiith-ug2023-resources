    - Digital Systems and Microcontrollers (EC2.101)
    - Real Analysis (MA4.101)

    - Electronic Workshop-1 (EC2.102)
- Semester 2
    - Linear Algebra (MA2.101)
    - Analog Electronic Circuits (EC2.103)
    - Information and Communication (EC5.102)
    - Data Structures and Algorithms (CS1.201)
- Semester 3
    - Science 1 (SC1.110)
